# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2025-09-04

Beatboxx: Recorder & Organizer ("Beatboxx", "we", "us") respects your privacy. This policy explains what data we handle and how. Our core principle is simple: your ideas stay yours, on your device.

Summary
- 100% on-device by default: recordings, tags, routines, and settings are stored locally on your device.
- No account, no tracking, no analytics SDKs.
- Optional backups: you can export and restore from your own iCloud or Google Drive private folder.
- Payments/donations are processed by Apple or Google; we never see your card details.

1) Data we process
- On-device content (local only):
  - Audio recordings you make in the app
  - Tags, routines, folders, battle prep structures, notes, and settings
- We do not collect: your name, email, or usage analytics in the app.
- Website: beatboxx.app may collect standard server logs and basic, privacy-friendly metrics if configured (e.g., aggregated traffic counts without cookies). We do not run ads.

2) Permissions and how they are used
- Microphone: to record audio you initiate.
- Local storage/Files: to save recordings and allow import/export.
- Network: only when you choose actions like opening a help link, visiting Instagram, or exporting backups to your chosen cloud provider.

3) Backups and cloud providers (optional)
- You may export backups to your own iCloud or Google Drive private folder and restore them later.
- These backups are under your control and subject to Apple or Google’s terms and privacy policies. Beatboxx does not operate any backend servers.
- When restoring, Beatboxx places your data back into the app so items remain organized as before.

4) Donations and payments
- Donations or in-app payments are handled by Apple App Store or Google Play. We receive confirmation of payment (e.g., a transaction ID) but not your full payment details.
- 80% of donations are directed to support the beatbox community (events, judges, venues). Distribution details may evolve, but our intent is community-first.

5) Children’s privacy
- Beatboxx is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

6) Data retention and deletion
- Your content remains on your device until you delete it or uninstall the app.
- To delete backups you created, remove them from your iCloud/Google Drive.

7) Security
- Your recordings and data are stored on your device. Use a device passcode and OS-level encryption features. We do not control your device security.

8) International users and your rights
- Rights available to you (e.g., access, deletion) depend on your local laws. Because Beatboxx does not maintain user accounts or store data on our servers, your rights are exercised directly on your device.

9) Changes to this policy
- We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the “Effective date” above and publish changes at https://beatboxx.app/privacy.
